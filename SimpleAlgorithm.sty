% This package provides new commands for typesetting simple algorithms. Each
% algorithm looks like a table containing an enumerated list of steps inside it.
%
% Author: Anton Rodomanov
%
% Usage example:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \usepackage{SimpleAlgorithm} % in the preamble
%
% \begin{SimpleAlgorithm}[title={Gradient Method},label=GradientMethod]
%   \begin{AlgorithmGroup}[Input]
%     Starting point $x_0$, step size $\alpha > 0$.
%   \end{AlgorithmGroup}
%   \AlgorithmGroupSeparator
%   \begin{AlgorithmGroup}[Iteration $k \geq 0$]
%     \begin{AlgorithmSteps}
%       \AlgorithmStep Compute the gradient $\nabla f(x_k)$.
%       \AlgorithmStep Update $x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha \nabla f(x_k)$.
%     \end{AlgorithmSteps}
%   \end{AlgorithmGroup}
% \end{SimpleAlgorithm}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Notes:
%   - To load the package, add the following command to the preamble:
%       \usepackage{SimpleAlgorithm}
%
%   - When loading the package, you can also specify the following options:
%       equation: This option turns on the equation mode. In this mode, all
%                 algorithms are treated like usual equations.
%     Example:
%       \usepackage[equation]{SimpleAlgorithm}
%
%   - The "SimpleAlgorithm" environment has two optional arguments, which can be
%     specified using the standard "keyword=value" syntax:
%       title: The title of the algorithm.
%       label: The label assigned to the algorithm for future referencing. Note
%              that you must not explicitly use the "\label" command for this.
%
%   - By default, each algorithm is numbered (using the "algorithm" counter). If
%     you want to disable the numbering for a particular algorithm, use the
%     "SimpleAlgorithm*" environment.
%
%   - Each "SimpleAlgorithm" environment must consist of one or several groups
%     ("AlgorithmGroup" environments), which can be thought of as the major
%     parts of the algorithm description (Input, Initialization, Main Loop,
%     Return, etc.). By default, the groups are not visually separated from each
%     other. If needed, you can use the "\AlgorithmGroupSeparator" command to
%     add a separator (the horizontal line).
%
%   - The "AlgorithmGroup" environment has one optional argument specifying the
%     title of the group.
%
%   - To specify the steps of the algorithm inside a group, use the
%     "AlgorithmSteps" environment. It has the same syntax as the usual
%     "enumerate" list with the only difference that you should use the
%     "\AlgorithmStep" command instead of "\item". Similarly to standard lists,
%     you can nest the "AlgorithmSteps" environment if needed.
%
%   - It is possible to label individual steps for future referencing. To assign
%     a label, simply add the corresponding "\label" command immediately after
%     "\AlgorithmStep".
